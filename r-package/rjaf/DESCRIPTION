Description: Personalized assignment to one of many treatment arms via regularized and clustered joint assignment forests as described in Ladhania, Spiess, Ungar, and Wu <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2311.0057>. The algorithm pools information across treatment arms: it considers a regularized forest-based assignment algorithm based on greedy recursive partitioning that shrinks effect estimates across arms; and it incorporates a clustering scheme that combines treatment arms with consistently similar outcomes.
